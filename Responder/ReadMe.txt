By: Emmanuel Godinez and Will Hardwick-Smith

Brief:
Small artificial intelligence project. The aim is to have
an AI entity that the user can have a "simple conversation"
with, have some "understanding of the user" (eg name, gender).
The user can also "ask" the entity about certain "subjects" that
the entity already knows, or can "search" for it on web.

Details:
	- Memory 
		- dictionary
Default dictionary file taken from Unix systems. Can be altered by
user by adding/removing words.

		- dictionary/definition
Is approximated to be 150Mb in space, however, this can be altered
as the user intends. (by adding/removing words)
